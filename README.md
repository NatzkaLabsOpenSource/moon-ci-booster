# moon - CI booster

A GitHub action for [moon](https://moonrepo.dev) that posts a failure summary when `moon ci` tasks fail. The comment includes the error message, the command that was run, and the stdout/stderr logs for each failed task, so you can diagnose failures without leaving the pull request.

When all tasks pass, the action does nothing.

## Installation

The action _must run after_ the `moon ci` command, and should run even when `moon ci` fails
(`if: success() || failure()`).

## Inputs

- `access-token` (`string`) - **Required.** A GitHub access token used to post comments on
  the pull request.
- `max-log-lines` (`number`) - Maximum number of log lines to include inline per task per
  stream (stdout/stderr). Logs exceeding this are printed to the CI console with a deep-link
  in the PR comment. Set to `0` to always link, never inline. Defaults to `200`.
- `workspace-root` (`string`) - Root of the moon workspace (if running in a sub-directory).
  Defaults to working directory.

Sharded matrix CI is supported automatically — the action matches the current runner via
`RUNNER_NAME` to disambiguate jobs, so each matrix leg gets its own comment with correct
deep links. No extra configuration is needed.

## Outputs

- `comment-created` (`string`) - Whether a comment was created or updated on the pull request.
- `has-failures` (`string`) - `'true'` if any failing tasks were found.
- `report` (`string`) - The generated failure summary markdown.

## Example

An example of the failure summary comment looks like the following:
